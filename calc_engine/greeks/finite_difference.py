"""
When we start building the code for this we really only need a class for each greek (and maybe not even that).
What we will do for ex is have a class perhaps call is DeltaFinDiff, and the class will take a model as an instance attribute and calculate the greek based on that.
The reason we do this is so we dont have to create every greek for every model, we only need to create the greeks and pass in the model.
